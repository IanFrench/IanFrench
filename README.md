### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ˜„
### My name is Ian French and I am a Mechanical Engineer. I have also done a fair amount of Project Management throughout my career.
### I have now added coding to my list of skills. In particular I am able to write code in Swift and Python. My goal is to merge all of these skills and move into a 
### management level position directing, among other resources, software developers.
